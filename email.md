# Email
Because hosting email on the same resources as your website is not ideal.
## Email Forwarding
If you simply need to forward email.

Company | Cost | Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| ForwardMX |  $ | Don't use, online but not response from owner.
| [ForwardEmail.net](https://forwardemail.net/#/) | free | Utilizes DNS records, not entirely secure
| [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/) | Free | Simple and straightfowrard, although rumblings about outages as long as two days.

## Email Providers
The following section was added because I feel it's helpful.
